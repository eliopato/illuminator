Manifests
=========

Manifests and other annotation files are downloaded from `zwdzwd's github page <https://zwdzwd.github.io/InfiniumAnnotation>`_ to match R package "SeSAMe"

Information compiled from zwzzwd's github docs and `illumina docs <https://support.illumina.com.cn/downloads/infinium-methylationepic-v2-0-product-files.html>`_

Manifest columns meaning
------------------------

* ``CpG_chrm, CpG_beg, CpG_end``: genomic coordinate for the target, length 2 for CpG, length 1 for SNP and CpH. beg is 0-based and end is 1-based like in bed files.
* ``target``: ``CG`` if the probe measures CpG methylation, reference allele if otherwise
* ``nextBase``: for infinium Type I probes, the actual extension base (on the probe strand) after bisulfite conversion (``A/C/T``)
* ``channel``: color channel, green (methylated) or red (unmethylated)
* ``type`` : probe type, Infinium-I or Infinium-II
* ``Probe_ID``: the probe ID.

  * First letters : Either ``cg`` (CpG), ``ch`` (CpH), ``mu`` (multi-unique), ``rp`` (repetitive element), ``rs`` (SNP probes), ``ctl`` (control), ``nb`` (somatic mutations found in cancer)
  * Last 4 characters : top or bottom strand (``T/B``), converted or opposite strand (``C/O``), Infinium probe type (``1/2``), and the number of synthesis for representation of the probe on the array (``1,2,3,â€¦,n``).
* ``*_A``, ``*_B`` : Informations for alleles A and B

  * ``address_[A/B]``: Chip/tango address for A-allele and B-allele. For Infinium type I, allele A is Unmethylated, allele B is Methylated. For type II, address B is not set as there is only one probe. Addresses match the Illumina IDs found in IDat files.
  * ``mapFlag`` : can be used to determine direction of the probe sequence. 0 means upstream and 16 means downstream.
  * ``mapChrm``
  * ``mapPos``
  * ``mapQ``
  * ``mapCigar``
  * ``Allele[A/B]_ProbeSeq`` : sequence of the probe identified in ``Address[A/B]`` column
  * ``mapNM`` : number of mutations
  * ``mapAS`` : alignment score
  * ``mapYD`` : bisulfite strand (``f/r/n``)

Mask columns meaning
----------------------

* ``Probe_ID``: Probe ID
* ``mask``: ","-delimited description of masks
* ``maskUniq``: unique short form of the mask without additional info.
* ``M_general``: TRUE/FALSE, merged from other masks, for example :

  * human: ``M_mapping+M_nonuniq+M_SNPcommon_5pt+M_1baseSwitchSNPcommon_5pt+M_2extBase_SNPcommon_5pt``
  * mouse: ``M_mapping+M_nonuniq``

Common masks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``M_mapping``: unmapped probes, or probes having too low mapping quality (alignment score under 35, either probe for Infinium-I) or Infinium-I probe allele A and B mapped to different locations
* ``M_nonuniq``: mapped probes but with mapping quality smaller than 10, either probe for Infinium-I
* ``M_uncorr_titration``: CpGs with titration correlation under 0.9. Functioning probes should have very high correlation with titrated methylation fraction.

Human masks (general and population-specific)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``M_commonSNP5_5pt``: mapped probes having at least a common SNP with MAF>=5% within 5bp from 3'-extension
* ``M_commonSNP5_1pt``: mapped probes having at least a common SNP with MAF>=1% within 5bp from 3'-extension
* ``M_1baseSwitchSNPcommon_1pt``: mapped Infinium-I probes with SNP (MAF>=1%) hitting the extension base and changing the color channel
* ``M_2extBase_SNPcommon_1pt``: mapped Infinium-II probes with SNP (MAF>=1%) hitting the extension base.
* ``M_SNP_EAS_1pt``: EAS population-specific mask (MAF>=1%).
* ``M_1baseSwitchSNP_EAS_1pt``: EAS population-specific mask (MAF>=1%).
* ``M_2extBase_SNP_EAS_1pt``: EAS population-specific mask (MAF>=1%).
* ... more populations, e.g., ``EAS``, ``EUR``, ``AFR``, ``AMR``, ``SAS``.

Mouse masks (general and strain-specific)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``M_PWK_PhJ``: mapped probes having at least a PWK_PhJ strain-specific SNP within 5bp from 3'-extension
* ``M_1baseSwitchPWK_PhJ``: mapped Infinium-I probes with PWK_PhJ strain-specific SNP hitting the extension base and changing the color channel
* ``M_2extBase_PWK_PhJ``: mapped Infinium-II probes with PWK_PhJ strain-specific SNP hitting the extension base.
* ... more strains, e.g., ``AKR_J``, ``A_J``, ``NOD_ShiLtJ``, ``MOLF_EiJ``, ``129P2_OlaHsd`` ...
